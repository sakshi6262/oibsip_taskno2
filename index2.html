        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Patel was born into a self-sufficient landowning family of the Leva Patidar caste. Reared in an atmosphere of
            traditional Hinduism, he attended primary school at Karamasad and high school at Petlad but was mainly
            self-taught. Patel married at the age of 16, matriculated at 22, and passed the district pleader
            examination, which enabled him to practice law. In 1900 he set up an independent office of district pleader
            in Godhra, and two years later he moved to Borsad.
            <br>

            Patel, however, was no revolutionary. In the crucial debate over the objectives of the Indian National
            Congress during the years 1928 to 1931, Patel believed (like Gandhi and Motilal Nehru, but unlike Jawaharlal
            Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose) that the goal of the Indian National Congress should be dominion status
            within the British Commonwealthâ€”not independence. In contrast to Jawaharlal Nehru, who condoned violence in
            the struggle for independence, Patel ruled out armed revolution, not on moral but on practical grounds.
            Patel held that it would be abortive and would entail severe repression. Patel, like Gandhi, saw advantages
            in the future participation of a free India in a British Commonwealth, provided that India was admitted as
            an equal member. He emphasized the need to foster Indian self-reliance and self-confidence, but, unlike
            Gandhi, he did not regard Hindu-Muslim unity as a prerequisite for independence.

            <br>
            He pledged unwavering support to the Mahatma and stood by his principles. While leaders including
            Chakravarthy Rajagopalachari and Maulana Azad criticized Mahatma Gandhi's idea that the civil disobedience
            movement would compel the British to leave the nation, Patel extended his support to Gandhi. Despite the
            unwillingness of the Congress High Command, Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel strongly forced the
            All India Congress Committee to ratify the civil disobedience movement and launch it without delaying
            further. Upon Gandhi request he gave up his candidacy for the post of the Prime Minister of India. He
            suffered a major heart attack after Gandhiji death. Although he recovered, he attributed it to having
            lamented silently for the loss of his mentor.
